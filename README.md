## Project Overview
* Who is the client or target audience of the app, and who will be using it?
	* Our primary users will be people who share a room, apartment, or house such as roommates.

* What is the purpose of the project?
	* Our goal is to build a mobile application that solves financial and communication problems for people who share a living space.

* What will it allow people to do?
	* This application will allow users to assign tasks to each other and create shopping list so that all users can see each individualâ€™s contribution to the group.

* What information will it communicate?
	* Spending: roommates can plan, track, and manage the spending on communal stuffs.
	* Tasks: roommates can assign tasks to each other.

* Why are you creating this app?
	* There are a large number of college students who prefer living with friends or even random people instead of living with their parents. However, it is unavoidable that conflicts will occur. For example, quarrels usually happen when a roommate always forgets to wash dishes and leave the dish sink dirty, or consumes too much communal food such as milk without contributing any. Failing to solve these conflicts usually ends up with breaking up friendship. But with our application, we hope to solve all of these problems for this particular group of people, so we can create a better living situation and enhance their friendship.
